Read both closely. Infer what this person needs and wants in a partner and in life, their hobbies, interests, values, personality and lifestyle. Cite concrete evidence from the sources (a job move, a caption, hashtags, locations, recurring subjects in posts).
Rules: never invent facts. Separate what is stated from what is inferred; put inferences in needs/values/personality and keep "evidence" for direct observations. If the sources are thin, say so and lower confidence. Do not infer protected traits (religion, health, orientation, ethnicity) - ignore them.
